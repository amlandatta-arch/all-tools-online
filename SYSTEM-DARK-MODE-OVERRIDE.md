## 🎯 Problem

**User's Issue:**
- Phone has dark mode enabled (system preference)
- Website was respecting the system dark mode
- User wants website to ALWAYS show light theme
- Even if device is in dark mode, website should be light

**Technical Issue:**
- CSS `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media query was being respected
- Browser was applying dark mode based on system settings
- No override was in place to force light theme

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Added Meta Tag**
```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light only" />
```
- Tells browser to ONLY use light color scheme
- Prevents automatic dark mode rendering
- Works on all modern browsers

### 2. **CSS Override for System Preference**
```css
/* Override system dark mode preference */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  html, body {
    background: #f7fafc !important;
    color: #1f2937 !important;
    color-scheme: light !important;
  }
  :root {
    --bg: #f7fafc !important;
    --card: #ffffff !important;
    --muted: #6b7280 !important;
  }
}
```
- Even if system is in dark mode, force light colors
- Uses `!important` to override all other styles
- Applies to all elements

### 3. **Force Light Color Scheme**
```css
html, body { 
  background: #f7fafc !important; 
  color: #1f2937 !important; 
  color-scheme: light !important;
}
```
