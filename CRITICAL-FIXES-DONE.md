## ✅ URGENT ISSUES FIXED

### 1. 🔴 NAVIGATION FROM TOOL PAGES - FIXED

**Problem:** 
- When visiting any tool page (e.g., age-calculator.html)
- Header and footer links (Home, About, Contact, etc.) were broken
- Links used absolute paths starting with `/` which don't work on GitHub Pages

**Root Cause:**
- `common.js` was using absolute paths: `/index.html`, `/about.html`
- These paths don't work when site is deployed to GitHub Pages subdirectory
- Tool pages are 2 levels deep: `tools/calculators/tool.html`

**Solution:**
- Added `getBasePath()` function to detect current page depth
- Returns `../../` for tool pages, empty string for root pages
- Updated all navigation links to use relative paths

**Changes Made:**

```javascript
// NEW: Dynamic path detection
function getBasePath() {
  const path = window.location.pathname;
  if (path.includes('/tools/')) {
    return '../../';
  }
  return '';
}

// BEFORE:
<a href="/index.html">Home</a>
<a href="/about.html">About</a>

// AFTER:
<a href="${basePath}index.html">Home</a>
<a href="${basePath}about.html">About</a>
```

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `assets/js/common.js` - Fixed all header/footer links

**Test:**
1. Open any tool page: `tools/calculators/age-calculator.html`
2. Click "Home" in header → Should go to homepage
3. Click "About" in header → Should open about.html
4. Click "Contact" in footer → Should open contact.html
5. All links should work correctly now

### 2. 🔴 DARK THEME ON MOBILE - FIXED

**Problem:**
- Mobile devices were loading dark theme by default
- Should default to light theme for better readability

**Root Cause:**
- Theme initialization was using `|| 'light'` which could be overridden
- No explicit check for null/undefined localStorage value

**Solution:**
- Changed theme initialization to explicitly check for saved preference
- Only use saved theme if it exists, otherwise default to 'light'

**Changes Made:**

```javascript
// BEFORE:
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';

// AFTER:
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
const theme = savedTheme ? savedTheme : 'light';
```

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `assets/js/common.js` - Fixed theme initialization
- ✅ `index.html` - Fixed theme initialization

**Test:**
1. Clear browser localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Open website on mobile
3. Should load with light theme (white background)
4. Toggle to dark theme
5. Refresh - should remember dark preference
6. Clear localStorage again - should default back to light

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Navigation Fix

**How it works:**
1. `getBasePath()` checks current URL path
2. If path contains `/tools/`, returns `../../` (go up 2 levels)
3. Otherwise returns empty string (same level)
4. All links use `${basePath}filename.html`

**Example:**
- From `index.html`: `${basePath}about.html` → `about.html`
- From `tools/calculators/age-calculator.html`: `${basePath}about.html` → `../../about.html`

### Theme Fix

**How it works:**
1. Check localStorage for saved theme
2. If exists, use saved theme
3. If null/undefined, default to 'light'
4. Never use system preference (which could be dark)

## ✅ Verification

### Navigation Verification:
```bash
# Test from tool page
Open: tools/calculators/age-calculator.html

Click: About → Should go to about.html ✓
Click: Contact → Should go to contact.html ✓
```

### Theme Verification:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
